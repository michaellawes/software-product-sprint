      <h1>Michael Lawes's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>Michael is a 19 year old student at Columbia University studying Computer Science in SEAS.</p>

      <p>Above is an image of my favorite character of all time, Mikoto Suoh. He is one of the antihero's in the anime series Project K.</p>
      <p>I grew in New York, more specifically Long Island. I always enjoyed math and science growing up and originally pursued research upon starting high school. My high school went from 7th to 12th in one building so I joined Science Research in 8th grade. Upon entering my senior year I decided I wanted to study CS as I realized research was not where my heart resided. Now I'm here </p>

      <p>I don't usually take photographs often. If I am taking a picture it's likely of either the clouds or the sky when it's orange or purple-ish. I do enjoy photoshoots of different outfits I put together, however, I never have time to take pictures or someone available who can photos :(. Maybe one day I'll learn how to use the self-timer and get a front-facing camera that doesn't have the quality of a 2007 Youtube video.</p>
